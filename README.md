# Purpose
This project is the static website focused on creating awareness about digital wellbeing and importance of getting away from screens once in a while. It aims at showing people that digital wellbeing can be achieved one step at a time. [The Unplugged Club](https://gayatrig19.github.io/the-unplugged-club/index.html) provides users with the guide and benefits of getting unplugged and what is getting unplugged all about. The core purpose of the website is to remind people that in the midst of constant notifications and distractions, it's essential to carve out moments of stillness, reflection, and genuine human interaction. It reflects on living life in a moment, reclaiming yourself and enjoying that "me time" without devices around i.e. Less Scorlling and More Living.
