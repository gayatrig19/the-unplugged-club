### Typography

- [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was chosen for logo and headings as it can be combined easily with other fonts. It is attractive and amenable for the heading content on site. Because it is slightly elongated, it brings contrast to a typography combination. With website consideration it was best suited as it gives both modern and a serious touch to the content throughout on pages.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was chosen for body text as it is light and easy to read.

### Images

- The images in this project are sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). They were specifically selected to correlate with the main purpose of the website and to give user a imagery representation for the content to increase impact of the design.

### Visual Effects

####  Overlay Texts and Shadows 
- As the website contains lots of high quality images for imagery purpose, it was important to add volume and make the content easier to perceive so the viewers are not distracted by the background rather are more focused on foreground information.
- The hero image on home page and on unplug here page contains overlay text to keep user focused on the purpose of the website.
- Each block of section is designed with effects to give website a more refined and clean look.
- The images are given effects for letting user get the feel of the website and relate to the content with some entertainment.

####  Benefits section, Guide to unplug section and Contact form Hover effect
- The  benefits section on home page, guide section on unplug here page and the contact form includes the hover effect to make the experience more interactive.
- When the user hovers over the blocks on benefits section and guide section, a transition effect is experienced.
- When the user engages with the input fields or hovers over, its border colour changes to sky blue to subtly highlight the item without compromising legibility.

### Features left to implement
- Contact form processing: Currently , on submission of the Contact form, the data goes to the form dump, so the input is not being processed or stored. With the knowledge of SQL and Python, the input could be stored, processed and analysed and used to provide the user with a personalised user-experience.
- Events Details: Currently, the website does not have any events page where user can find events taking place around for activities whilst on the journey. This can help user get more socialised offline with friends and families.
