# THE UNPLUGGED CLUB
![Website Mock Up](assets/images/readme/mockup.png)

### [The live website is avaiable here](https://gayatrig19.github.io/the-unplugged-club/index.html)

# Purpose
This project is the static website focused on creating awareness about digital wellbeing and importance of getting away from screens once in a while. It aims at showing people that digital wellbeing can be achieved one step at a time. [The Unplugged Club](https://gayatrig19.github.io/the-unplugged-club/index.html) provides users with the guide and benefits of getting unplugged and what it is all about. 
The core purpose here is to remind people that in the midst of constant notifications and distractions, it is essential to carve out moments of stillness, reflection, and genuine human interaction. It reflects on living life in a moment, reclaiming yourself and enjoying that "me time" without devices around. The website focuses on ideas of taking small steps towards spending time away from devices and screens and getting more mindful living life to fullest. The website uses clean, simple design with earthy colors and images that showcases the energies of living life beyond screens.

The website is built using HTML and CSS as a Milestone Project#1 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course.

## Typography

-[Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was chosen for logo and headings as it can be combined easily with other fonts. It is attractive and amenable for the heading content on site. Because it is slightly elongated, it brings contrast to a typography combination. With website consideration it was best suited as it gives both modern and a serious touch to the content throughout on pages.

-[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was chosen for body text as it is light and easy to read.
