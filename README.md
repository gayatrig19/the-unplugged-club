### [The live website is avaiable here](https://gayatrig19.github.io/the-unplugged-club/index.html)

# Purpose
This project is the static website focused on creating awareness about digital wellbeing and importance of getting away from screens once in a while. It aims at showing people that digital wellbeing can be achieved one step at a time. [The Unplugged Club](https://gayatrig19.github.io/the-unplugged-club/index.html) provides users with the guide and benefits of getting unplugged and what it is all about. 
-The core purpose here is to remind people that in the midst of constant notifications and distractions, it is essential to carve out moments of stillness, reflection, and genuine human interaction. It reflects on living life in a moment, reclaiming yourself and enjoying that "me time" without devices around. The website focuses on ideas of taking small steps towards spending time away from devices and screens and getting more mindful living life to fullest. The website uses clean, simple design with earthy colors and images that showcases the energies of living life beyond screens.

-The website is built using HTML and CSS as a Milestone Project#1 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course.

### Typography

-[Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was chosen for logo and headings as it can be combined easily with other fonts. It is attractive and amenable for the heading content on site. Because it is slightly elongated, it brings contrast to a typography combination. With website consideration it was best suited as it gives both modern and a serious touch to the content throughout on pages.

-[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was chosen for body text as it is light and easy to read.

### Images

- The images in this project are sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). They were specifically selected to correlate with the main purpose of the website and to give user a imagery representation for the content to increase impact of the design.

### Visual Effects

####  Overlay Texts and Shadows 
- As the website contains lots of high quality images for imagery purpose, it was important to add volume and make the content easier to perceive so the viewers are not distracted by the background rather are more focused on foreground information.
- The hero image on home page and on unplug here page contains overlay text to keep user focused on the purpose of the website.
- Each block of section is designed with effects to give website a more refined and clean look.
- The images are given effects for letting user get the feel of the website and relate to the content with some entertainment.

####  Benefits section, Guide to unplug section and Contact form Hover effect
- The  benefits section on home page, guide section on unplug here page and the contact form includes the hoover effect to make the experience more interactive.
- When the user hovers over the blocks on benefits section and guide section, a transition effect is experienced.
- When the user engages with the input fields or hovers over, its border colour changes to sky blue to subtly highlight the item without compromising legibility.
